# Tether-Project
I've been following blockchain projects for over a year now and firmly believe that there is a bright future for Bitcoin and some of alternative cryptocurrencies. Price of Bitcoin currently stands around 6,000usd and is massively manipulated by only a few actors on the market, mostly by owners/managers of Bitfinex exchange and Tether Ltd.

#Goal

The goal of this project is to learn and demonstrate skills of data manipulation and visualization using SQL Server, R and Microsoft Excel. 

#Plan

My plan is to run Omni Core on my server (layer on Bitcoin network) so I can get reliable, untampered data and import data into SQL Server 2017. I will manipulate data in SQL Server to get useful dataset which will be used later to visualize network of tether transactions in a meaningful way. Further analysis will be done in Microsoft Excel using data models.
